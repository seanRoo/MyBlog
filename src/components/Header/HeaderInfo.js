      I'm an Irish ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª Front-End Software Engineer with a strong Computer Science
      background from my Undergraduate - Computer Science & Economics (BA -
      Three years) and my Masters - Computer Science (MSc - Two years). I'm a
      huge advocate of learning by doing and tend to pick up new skills,
      languages and frameworks quickly. Clean code, solid tests and high output
      are qualities I bring to a development team. Check out my list of projects
      or resume below!

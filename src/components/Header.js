      I'm an Irish front end Software Engineer based in Vancouver ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. I have a
      strong Computer Science backround from my Undergraduate - Computer Science
      & Economics (BA - Three years) and my Masters - Computer Science (MSc -
      Two years). I'm a huge advocate of learning by doing and tend to pick up
      new skills, languages and frameworks quickly. Clean code, solid tests and
      high outpute are qualities I bring to a dev team. Check out my list of
      projects or CV below!
